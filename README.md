# crypto-invoicer

crypto-invoicer is a personal web portal for invoicing clients with Bitcoin.
This is a new copy

It allows you to:

- Generate email invoices for your clients
- Ask the client to pay you using USD, BTC, or their local currency
- Transfers the money to you in Bitcoin
- View, sort, and list invoices

It's a simple application meant to showcase the power of Node.js,
[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com), and [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/).

## Technical Details

This application is built with [Express.js][], plain old HTML and [Bootstrap][]
for CSS.  I'm also using a Bootstrap theme called [Sketchy][] which makes
things look like a mockup. I really love this theme.

The invoicing API is powered by Coinbase, and uses the officially supported
[coinbase-node][] developer library.

I'm also using:

- [sorttable][], a simple JavaScript library that lets you make your tables
  sortable. This is what powers the sortable tables for listing client invoices.
- [asyncjs][], a popular JavaScript library for managing asynchronous flow.
- [pug.js][], a popular HTML templating language.
- [oidc-middleware][], a popular OpenID Connect authentication middleware created
  by Okta.
